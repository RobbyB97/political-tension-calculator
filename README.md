# Political Tension Calculator

## Overview

It is well known that political leaders don't always announce when and where they are going to initiate military strikes. Not only do their people hear their words, but everyone else in the world does too. So often times, political leaders make an effort to not reveal their plans directly and publicly. It may be possible to train a machine learning model to be able to read between the lines of the words of political leaders and predict the likelihood of imminent military action with a higher degree of accuracy than a human can. This is what we ultimately hope to achieve with this project.
